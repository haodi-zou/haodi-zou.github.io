👋 Hi! I'm Haodi Zou (邹灏迪). I'm a senior undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Computer Science 👩🏻‍💻.

<u>Research</u> 🔍

At Berkeley, I've engaged in research on **human-computer interaction** and **social computing** under the guidance of Professors [Niloufar Salehi](https://niloufar.org/), [Coye Cheshire](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~coye/), and PhD candidate [Sijia Xiao](https://applexiao.com/). My work focuses on building systems to empower online harm survivors through a restorative justice framework.

Additionally, with Professor [Niloufar Salehi](https://niloufar.org/) and PhD student [Sabriya Alam](https://sites.google.com/view/sabriyaalam), I've conducted research in **human-centered AI**, specifically developing an AI-powered system to enhance healthcare communication.

My research experience also extends to the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), where I've worked on improving the reliability of image captioning models under the mentorship of Professors [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/), [Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/), [John Canny](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/), and PhD candidates [Suzie Petryk](https://suziepetryk.com/) and [David Chan](https://dchan.cc/).

<u>Industry</u> 💼

Besides academic research, I've also interned at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as a software engineer.

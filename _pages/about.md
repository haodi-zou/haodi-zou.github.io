👋 Hi! I'm Haodi Zou (邹灏迪). I'm a 1st-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Deepak Kumar](https://kumarde.com/). My research interests lie in human-computer interaction, social computing, and online harm.

Before coming to UCSD, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). At Berkeley, I've been fortunate to engage in research on social computing and human-centered AI in Prof. [Niloufar Salehi](https://niloufar.org/)'s research group.

Besides academic research, I've also interned at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as a software engineer.

<!-- **🔍 Research**

At Berkeley, I've engaged in research on **human-computer interaction** and **social computing** under the guidance of Professors [Niloufar Salehi](https://niloufar.org/), [Coye Cheshire](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~coye/), and PhD candidate [Sijia Xiao](https://applexiao.com/). My work focuses on building systems to empower online harm survivors through a restorative justice framework.

Additionally, with Professor [Niloufar Salehi](https://niloufar.org/) and PhD student [Sabriya Alam](https://sites.google.com/view/sabriyaalam), I've conducted research in **human-centered AI**, specifically developing an AI-powered system to enhance healthcare communication.

My research experience also extends to the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), where I've worked on improving the reliability of image captioning models under the mentorship of Professors [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/), [Joseph Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/), [John Canny](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/), and PhD candidates [Suzie Petryk](https://suziepetryk.com/) and [David Chan](https://dchan.cc/).

**💼 Industry**

Besides academic research, I've also interned at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as a software engineer.

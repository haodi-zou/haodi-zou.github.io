  title={SAGE: System for Accessible Guided Exploration of Health Information},
  author={Alam, Sabriya M. and Zou, Haodi and Vir, Reya and Salehi, Niloufar},
  abstract={The Center for Disease Control estimates that 6 in 10 adults in the United States live with a chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Yet most patients lack sufficient access to comprehensible information and guidance for effective self-management of chronic conditions and remain unaware of gaps in their knowledge. To address this challenge, we introduce SAGE, a System for Accessible Guided Exploration of healthcare information. SAGE is an information system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help patients identify and fill gaps in their understanding through automated organization of healthcare information, generation of guiding questions, and retrieval of reliable and accurate answers to patient queries. While LLMs may be a powerful intervention for these tasks, they pose risks and lack reliability in such high-stakes settings. One approach to address these limitations is to augment LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) containing well-structured and pre-verified health information. Thus, SAGE demonstrates how LLMs and KGs can complement each other to aid in the construction and retrieval of structured knowledge. By integrating the flexibility and natural language capabilities of LLMs with the reliability of KGs, SAGE seeks to create a collaborative system that promotes knowledge discovery for informed decision-making and effective self-management of chronic conditions.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
